            <p>Batman, also known as the Dark Knight, is a vigilante dedicated to protecting Gotham City. He fights crime with his superior intellect, detective skills, and an arsenal of advanced technology.

Batman, along with his trusted allies such as Commissioner Gordon and Robin, faces villains like the Joker, Bane, and Catwoman. His mission is to restore justice and protect the citizens from the city's darkness.</p>
