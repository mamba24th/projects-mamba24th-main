      <h2 id="highlight">List of fav Rappers</h2>
      <p>I love listening to rap music. The rappers that I love to listen to are <span class="special-text">Eminem</span>, <span class="special-text">Kendrick Lamar</span>, <span class="special-text">Drake</span>, and <span class="special-text">Travis Scott</span>.</p>
      <p>The reason why I love to listen to them is because of their creativity in their lyrics, and the way they deliver it when they are rapping is pure talent and flawless.</p>  
      <br>
      <h2>Rap Music</h2>
      <p>Here are the list of my favorite rap music: "Lose Yourself" by Eminem, "Love" by Kendrick Lamar, "Started from the Bottom" by Drake, and "Goosebumps" by Travis Scott.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>About Links</h2>
      <p> 
        A <strong>relative link</strong> is a link that points to a file within the same website. For example, here's a relative link to my <a href="https://cs401w2018.github.io/projects-mamba24th/activities/Profile.html">Profile Page</a>. 
        In contrast, an <strong>absolute link</strong> points to an external website. Hereâ€™s an example: 
        <a href="https://today.yougov.com/ratings/entertainment/fame/rap-hiphop-artists/men" target="_blank">YouGov</a>, a website that has the list of famous Rappers in US.

      <h2>Color Choices for Emphasis and De-emphasis</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>What color did you choose to emphasize text? <span class="special-text">Blue (#007bff)</span></li>
          <li>What color did you choose to de-emphasize text? <span style="color:#555;">Dark gray (#555)</span></li>
          <li>How did you choose your colors? I chose my colors for good contrast. I did not use an online tool but relied on common color contrast principles.</li>
