        <h2>1. How much time should you spend on an engagement assignment after class? </h2>
        <p> - The amount of time to spend on an engagement assignment after class depends on a few factors: 
            Assignment Length: Shorter assignments may only need 1 hour, while longer ones could require 2-3 hours or more. 
            Complexity: If the topic is challenging, you might need extra time to understand the material. 
            Your Understanding: If you feel confident about the subject, you might spend less time; if not, spend more to study and clarify concepts. 
            Deadline: Start early to avoid last-minute stress, and plan your time accordingly. 
            As a general rule, aim for 1-3 hours per assignment, adjusting based on these factors.</p>
            <h2>2. What should you focus on?</h2>
                <p>To get started with HTML web design, I need to focus on these basics:

                    HTML Structure: Know how an HTML page is set up (like using !DOCTYPE html, html, head, and body).
                    
                    Common Tags: Learn important tags like headings (h1 to h6), paragraphs (p), links (a), images (img), and lists (ul, ol).
                    
                    Attributes: Understand how to use attributes (like href for links and src for images).
                    
                    Semantic HTML: Use meaningful tags (like header, footer, and article) to help with accessibility and SEO.
                    
                    Forms: Learn how to create forms with input fields (input, textarea, select).
                    
                    Basic CSS: Get a basic idea of CSS for styling your HTML elements.
                    
                    Responsive Design: Learn how to make your website look good on different devices.
                    
                    Accessibility: Follow guidelines to make your site usable for everyone (like using alt text for images).
                    
                    Best Practices: Keep your code organized and readable.
                    
                    Version Control: Try tools like Git to keep track of changes in your projects.
                    
                    Focusing on these points will give me a strong start in HTML web design!</p>
                        <h2>3.What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h2>
                            <p>The main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox lies in their layout capabilities and intended use: 
                                CSS Grid: 2D Layout: Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to control both rows and columns simultaneously. 
                                Complex Layouts: Itâ€™s great for creating complex web layouts, like entire page structures, with overlapping elements and precise positioning. 
                                Grid Lines and Areas: You can define grid lines and areas, making it easier to place items in specific locations. 
                                CSS Flexbox: 1D Layout: Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, meaning it works either in a row or a column, but not both at the same time. 
                                Alignment and Distribution: It excels at aligning and distributing space among items in a single direction, making it ideal for simpler layouts like navigation bars or centering elements. 
                                Flex Items: Flex items can grow or shrink to fit the available space, allowing for flexible designs.</p>
