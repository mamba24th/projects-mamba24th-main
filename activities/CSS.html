        <h2>Answer the following question</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>List out the different ways to select an item.</h3>
        <p>Random Selection: Choose an item by chance, like drawing names from a hat.

            Criteria-Based Selection: Pick items based on specific criteria, such as size, color, or price.
            
            Majority Vote: Let a group of people vote on their favorite option, and choose the one with the most votes.
            
            First-Come, First-Served: Select items based on the order in which they are chosen or requested.
            
            Quality Comparison: Evaluate items side by side to see which one meets your needs best.
            
            Trial and Error: Try different items until you find the one you like.
            
            Recommendation: Choose based on suggestions from friends, experts, or reviews.
            
            Process of Elimination: Start with all options and gradually remove those that don't meet your needs until you find one.</p>

            <h3>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h3>
            <p>An ID is a unique identifier for a single element on a webpage, meaning no two elements can have the same ID. It’s marked with a # in CSS (like #header).
                 A Class, on the other hand, can be used on multiple elements, allowing you to group them together for styling; it's marked with a . in CSS (like .button). 
                 In short, use an ID for unique elements and a class for elements that share the same style.</p>
                 <br>
                 <h3>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</h3>
                 <p>The main difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag lies in their purpose and display behavior.
                     A SPAN tag is an inline element, meaning it does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary; 
                     it’s often used to style or group small portions of text within a line. 
                     In contrast, a DIV tag is a block-level element, which means it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available; 
                     it’s typically used to group larger sections of content or layout structures. In summary, use SPAN for inline styling and DIV for block-level grouping.</p>
                     <h3>What is the difference between a DIV tag and HEADER, MAIN, FOOTER?</h3>
                     <p>The DIV tag is a generic container used to group content without specific meaning, while HEADER, MAIN, and FOOTER are semantic tags that define the structure of a webpage. 
                        HEADER is used for introductory content like logos and navigation, MAIN represents the primary content of the page, and FOOTER contains information like copyright and links at the bottom. 
                        In short, DIV is flexible and non-specific, whereas HEADER, MAIN, and FOOTER provide meaningful context about the page's layout.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>What are different ways to select a color?</h3>
                        <p>You can select a color in various ways, such as using a color wheel to find complementary colors, specifying RGB values (like RGB(255, 0, 0) for red), or using hex codes (like #FF0000 for red).
                             You can also choose colors with HSL values (Hue, Saturation, Lightness), use color pickers in design software, refer to predefined colors like "blue," or use sampling tools to pick colors from images. 
                             Additionally, creating mood boards can help you visualize and select a cohesive color palette.</p>
