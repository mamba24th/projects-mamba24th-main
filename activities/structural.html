        <H2>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</H2>
        <P>An absolute link points to a specific location on the internet, including the full URL (like https://www.example.com/page), while a relative link points to a location relative to the current page (like page.html). </p>
        <h2>List the 3 rules with relative links.</h2>   
        <p>Here are three rules for using relative links: 
            Same Directory: Use just the filename (e.g., page.html) to link to files in the same directory. 
            Subdirectory: Include the subdirectory name followed by a slash (e.g., folder/page.html) to link to files in a subfolder. 
            Parent Directory: Use ../ to go up one level in the directory structure (e.g., ../page.html) to link to files in the parent directory.</p> 
        <h2>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h2>
        <p>No, links don't have to be inside a nav tag. You can put them anywhere in your HTML, like in paragraphs or headers. Using a nav tag helps organize navigation links and makes your site easier to understand for users and search engines.</p>
