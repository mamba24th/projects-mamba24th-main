        1. What you learned about Flex and CSS.
    </h2>
        <p> - Flexbox, or Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout model that makes it easier to design responsive web pages. 
            It allows you to arrange items in a container along a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.
             With Flexbox, you can control the size, spacing, and alignment of elements, ensuring they adapt smoothly to different screen sizes. 
             This means you can create layouts that look great on both desktop and mobile devices without complex calculations or extra CSS. 
             Overall, Flexbox simplifies the process of creating flexible and visually appealing designs.</p>

                2. Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?

             </h2>
                <p>
                    Having an accessible website means designing it so that all users, including those with disabilities, can navigate and interact with it effectively. 
                    Accessibility is important because it ensures that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access information and services online. 
                    This includes providing text alternatives for images, using clear and simple language, and ensuring that the website works well with assistive technologies like screen readers. 
                    An accessible website not only broadens your audience but also complies with legal standards and demonstrates a commitment to inclusivity. 
                    Ultimately, it enhances the user experience for everyone.
