    <h2>1.What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h2>
    <p>
        JPEG is great for: Photographs: Ideal for colorful images with gradients (e.g., landscapes, portraits). Web Images: Common for website backgrounds and product photos. Social Media: Widely used for sharing photos online.
    </p>
    <h2>2.What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h2>
    <p>GIF is best suited for: Simple Graphics: Ideal for logos, icons, and illustrations with limited colors. Animations: Perfect for short, looping animations, like memes or animated banners. Images with Transparency: GIF supports transparency, making it good for images that need a clear background.</p>
    <h2>3.What is unique about the PNG format?</h2>
    <p>PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is unique because:

        Lossless Compression: It retains all image quality without losing detail, making it great for high-quality images.
        
        Transparency Support: PNG allows for transparent backgrounds, perfect for logos and graphics that need to blend seamlessly with different backgrounds.
        
        Better Color Depth: Supports a wide range of colors (up to 16 million), making it ideal for detailed images.</p>
        <h2>4.How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h2>
        <p>To resize a photo for display, you can set the dimensions directly in HTML using the <img> tag or CSS. Alternatively, you can use image editing software or online tools to change the size before uploading it to your website.</p>
        <h2>5.Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? </h2>
        <p>
            Resizing photos using photo editing software is better because it ensures better image quality and faster loading times, as the file size is reduced before upload. CSS resizing only changes the display size in the browser, which can lead to larger file sizes and slower loading without improving image quality.</p>
