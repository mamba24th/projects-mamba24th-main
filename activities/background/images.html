    <h2>1. When should you use a background image, and when should you use the IMG tag?</h2>
    <p>
        Use a background image when you want to create a visual effect or style for an element (like a section or the entire page) that doesn’t require interaction. It’s often used for decorative purposes. Use the <img> tag when you want to display an image that is content-related, such as a photo, graphic, or illustration that conveys information. This ensures the image is accessible, can be indexed by search engines, and is important for the understanding of the content.
