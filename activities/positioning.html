                <h2>1. What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give</h2>
                    <p>Block tags start on a new line and take up the full width available. Examples: div, p, h1.
                        Inline tags do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as needed. Examples: span, a, strong. 
                    </p>
                        <h2>2. What is normal flow in HTML?</h2>
                            <p>Normal flow is how elements are arranged on a webpage by default, stacking block elements vertically and inline elements horizontally.</p>
        <h2>3. What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h2>
                    <p>Float moves an element to the left or right of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it.
                        You need to clear the float to ensure that elements that follow are correctly positioned below the floated elements. 
                    </p>
                        <h2>4. What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h2>
                            <p>Absolute: Positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (not static).
                                Fixed: Positions an element relative to the viewport, so it stays in the same place when scrolling.
                                Relative: Positions an element relative to its original position, allowing for slight adjustments.
                            </p>
                                <h2>5.How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h2>
                                    <p>To create nice navigation buttons for mobile:
                                        Use simple buttons with clear text.
                                        Style them with CSS for colors, padding, and hover effects.
                                        Consider using a hamburger menu icon for compact navigation.
                                    </p>
                                        <h2>6. Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h2>
                                            <p>You can find videos on platforms like YouTube, educational websites (like Khan Academy), or course platforms (like Coursera) that cover web development topics.</p>
