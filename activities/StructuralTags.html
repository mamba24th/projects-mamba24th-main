    <h2>1.What goes in the header?</h2>
    <p>In HTML, the header contains metadata about the document, such as the title, links to stylesheets, and scripts, and is enclosed within the <head> tags.<p>
    <h2>2. What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?</h2>   
    <p>The nav element contains navigation links to different sections of the website. Yes, the nav can go inside the header , but it doesnâ€™t have to. The nav can also include links to other websites.</p>
    <h2>3. What goes in Main?</h2>
    <p>The main element contains the main content of the webpage, such as articles, sections, or any information that is directly related to the topic of the page. It should be unique to that page and is where the primary content is displayed.</p>
    <h2>4. What goes in the Footer?</h2>
    <p>The footer contains information at the bottom of the page, such as copyright notices, links to privacy policies, contact information, and additional navigation links. It typically provides closing details about the website.</p>
    <h2>5. HTML Validation</h2>
    <p>HTML validation is the process of checking your HTML code against web standards to ensure it is correctly structured and free of errors. This helps ensure that your webpage displays properly across different browsers and devices. You can use online tools like the W3C Validator to check your HTML for compliance with standards.</p>
