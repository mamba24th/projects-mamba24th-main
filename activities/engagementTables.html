    <h1>1. Why don't we use the border property?</h1>
        <p>We often avoid using the border property for visual styling in favor of more flexible options like CSS frameworks, as they can offer better design consistency and responsiveness.</p>
    <h1>2. What is the easiest way to color every other row a different color?</h1>
        <p>The easiest way to color every other row in a table is by using CSS. 
            You can apply the nth-child selector to target those rows. 
            Here’s how: Use the tr selector for table rows. Add :nth-child(even) to color every second row (the even rows). 
            Here’s a simple example: css Copy code tr:nth-child(even) { background-color: lightgray; /* Change this to your desired color */ } This will color every other row starting from the second one. 
            If you want to color the odd rows instead, use :nth-child(odd).</p>
    <h1>3. When should we use a table?</h1>
        <p>Use a table when you need to display data that is best represented in a grid format, such as financial data, schedules, or comparisons. Tables help in organizing and presenting this information clearly.</p>
