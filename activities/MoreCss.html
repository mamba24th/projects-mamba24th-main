    <h2>1.What is the difference between block tags and inline tags.</h2>
    <p> - In HTML, the main difference between block tags and inline tags is how they display content: 
        Block Tags: Take up the full width of their container. Start on a new line. Examples: div,p, h1, ul. 
        Inline Tags: Only take up as much width as necessary. Do not start on a new line; they flow within the text. 
        Examples: span, a, strong, img. In summary, block tags create distinct sections, while inline tags are used within those sections.</p>
    <br>
    <h2> 2.What is the margin, border, and padding?</h2>
    <p>Margin: The space outside an element that separates it from other elements.

        Border: A line that surrounds an element, sitting between the margin and padding.
        
        Padding: The space inside an element, between the content and the border.</p>

    <h2>3. What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h2>
    <p> In CSS, you can use several units of measurement, which can be broadly categorized into two types: absolute and relative.</p>
    <p>Absolute Units:
        px (pixels): A fixed unit based on screen resolution.
        pt (points): Typically used in print; 1 point is 1/72 of an inch.
        in (inches): Directly based on physical measurements.
        cm (centimeters): Another physical measurement.
        mm (millimeters): A smaller physical measurement.</p>
    <p>Relative Units:
        em: Relative to the font size of the element (or its parent).
        rem: Relative to the font size of the root element (usually <html>).
        % (percent): Relative to the parent element's size.
        vw (viewport width): 1% of the width of the viewport.
        vh (viewport height): 1% of the height of the viewport.
        vmin: The smaller value of vw or vh.
        vmax: The larger value of vw or vh.</p>

    <h2>4. When would you use a figure tag?</h2>
    <p>The figure tag is used in HTML to enclose media like images or diagrams along with a caption that explains them. It helps organize content and improve its meaning.</p>
