        <h3> Why is the viewport meta tag important?</h3>
        <p> The viewport meta tag helps control how a webpage is displayed on different devices, especially mobile ones. 
            It tells the browser how to adjust the page's dimensions and scaling, making sure that content fits well on smaller screens. 
            Without it, a website might appear too zoomed out or too small to read, leading to a poor user experience.</p>
        
        <h3> How can you adjust the CSS for printing?</h3>
        <p> To adjust the CSS for printing, you can use a special section called a media query that targets print styles. 
            Hereâ€™s how you can do it simply: Create a Media Query: This is a block in your CSS that will only apply when the page is printed. 
            Write Print-Specific Styles: Inside this block, you can add styles that change how elements look when printed.</p>
        
        <h3> When would you want to adjust the CSS for printing?</h3>
        <p> You would want to adjust the CSS for printing when you want to improve the print layout of a webpage. 
            This could include: Hiding Navigation: Removing menus or links that are irrelevant in print. 
            Adjusting Font Sizes: Making text larger or smaller for better readability. Simplifying Layout: Changing the layout to a single column to make it easier to read on paper. 
            Adding Print-Specific Styles: Including elements like page numbers or headers that only make sense in print. These adjustments ensure that printed pages look clean and professional, making it easier for users to read and use the printed information.</p>
